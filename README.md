I AM DISCONTINUING THIS PROJECT BECAUSE I AM UPGRADING IT TO A FULL FLEGED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, WHICH REQUIRES ME TO MAKE DRASTIC CHANGES TO THE CODE BASE AND PROJECT STRUCTURE. SO IVE DECIDED NOT TO USE THIS SAME REPO COZ AM EVEN REFACTORING TO TYPESCRIPT. EVERYTHING HERE WORKS AND IS BUG FREE EXCEPT THAT I HADNT IMPLEMENTED ANALYTICS AND REPORTING 
WHAT WORKS
-POS OPERATIONS (ALL CART OPERATIONS, PAYMENT , DISCOUNTING, TRANSACTIONS ,INVOICE GENERATION,PRINTING AND EMAILING etc)
-ROLE BASED AUTH
-STOCK MANAGEMENT
-COLLECTIONS (FOR ADVANCED SALES)
-CONFIGURATION (Lots of things i cant mention here)
